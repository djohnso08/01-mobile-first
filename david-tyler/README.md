## Overview
<!-- This excercise is showing us all about static pages.  we are trying to build a page for bacon baseball and kittens.  Our goal is to have pictures of each and words describing each;  we want it to show in both mobile and desktop.  there is a feature where the nav bar changes into a hamburger menu if the width gets too thin.  -->

## Getting Started
<!-- user would first have to psuedo code once they figured out the problem domain
the user than would have to know how they wanted their page to look (create a wireframe)functionality considerations would come next.
once a user knows what outcome they are after they can start coding.  
coding starts with an over all layout and creating ur directories and folders.

## Architecture
<!-- used SMACSS to organize CSS;
 used CLEARFIX, to help detach children from their parents; 
 used viewport to determine a screen width; 
 used meta charset utf8 to specify character set -->
